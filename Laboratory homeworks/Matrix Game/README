Flappy bird:

For this project I'll use the following components: LED matrix 8x8, MAX7219 driver, Joystick and LCD.
For playing this game, we will use de Joystick. When pressed, the 'bird' goes up by 2 rows (in the matrix). If the 'bird' doesn't receive any input, it will go down in rows at constant pace. The game is over when the 'bird' hits a wall or when it goes under the last row of the matrix.
On the LCD will be shown the menu of the game with the following options: Start the game, Setup and Highscore.
